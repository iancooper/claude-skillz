## System Prompts

- **super-tdd-developer** - TDD/DDD expert that auto-loads tdd-process, software-design-principles, and critical-peer-personality skills
- **claude-code-optimizer** - Workflow optimization specialist for improving Claude Code productivity
- **requirements-expert** - Requirements analysis specialist for breaking down features into specifications

## Composability

System prompts use @ references to load skills efficiently:

1. Add a `## Skills` section to your system prompt
2. Reference skills: `- @~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
3. Run `claude-launcher` - it imports skills before launching

This avoids Read operations that consume 18k+ tokens of context.

See `system-prompts/super-tdd-developer.md` for an example.

## Tools

- **claude-launcher** - Interactive system prompt selector for session start
